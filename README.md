# Weathering-with-you
# Objective
# Create a simple web application that allows users to search for weather information by city name. The application will display current weather details fetched from a weather API.
# Key Features
# User Input for City: A text input field where users can type the name of a city whose weather they want to check.
# Fetching Weather Data: Use the Fetch API to get weather data from a public weather API like OpenWeatherMap.
# Displaying Weather Information: Show the weather information on the webpage, including temperature, humidity, weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rain, etc.), and possibly an icon representing the current weather.
# Error Handling: Implement error handling for the API requests, such as displaying a message when the city cannot be found or when there's an issue with the API request.
# Asynchronous JavaScript: Use async/await for handling asynchronous API requests.
# Styling: Apply basic CSS to make the dashboard user-friendly and visually appealing.

# On search. Display shows:
# City and Country name
# Local date and time at time of request.
# Current weather icon, description, temperature in Celsius and humidity.
# Forecast every 12 hours for 4 days showing weather icon and temperature.
